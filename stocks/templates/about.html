<h2>About</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
        Fence Street is a New York Stock Exchange simulator, this project was created at Universit√© Paris VIII in 2021.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can freely check stock quotes, get the latest informations, news and access different charts
        (Intraday time series, opening & closing prices, and daily charts under Watchlist) for companies' stocks listed on the NYSE.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you register, you can have access to a <i>Watchlist</i> where you can add all the companies you're interested in so
        you can easily follow them all in one place. Fundamental informations will be displayed for convenience.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, you don't need to have money to try being a trader.
        <br>
        <br>
        The <i>Simulator</i> is here for you, you will start with $25k dollars, the amount required to become a day trader in the USA.
        You will be able to use this money to buy stocks and sell them under <i>"Order stock"</i>,
        to buy a stock you simply need to add its ticker (symbol) under <i>'Ticker name'</i> and the quantity you would like to buy,
        to sell them you will need to enter the ticker ID number of the stocks you want to get rid of and the amount you would like to sell.
        You can also sell every stock you own for a company by clicking on the <i>"Sell All"</i> button on the right side.
        <br>
        <br>
        The simulator displays your wallet and how much you currently have, the Portfolio table displays the oldest
        stock you bought at the top, the most recent one at the bottom. You will see the stock's ID number, its ticker,
        the quantity you bought and how much you bought it for, next to it you will see its current price in realtime,
        how much of a difference it is compared to when you bought it and under <i>'Total Value'</i> is the amount you would
        make if you sold it all now.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the bottom you will find your <i>Transaction history</i>, it will keep track of all your transactions, the date and time when you bought something or sold something,
        how much you bought or sold, what it was and how much you made or lost.
        <br>
